# SaaS Benchmarks Platform

[![Build Status](https://github.com/[organization]/saas-benchmarks-platform/workflows/ci/badge.svg)](https://github.com/[organization]/saas-benchmarks-platform/actions)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

A first-of-its-kind centralized platform providing comprehensive benchmark data across 14 key performance indicators (KPIs) for SaaS companies. The platform enables data-driven decision-making through easily accessible, current benchmark data with granular filtering capabilities.

## Key Features

- 14 SaaS KPIs with detailed percentile distributions
- Interactive filtering by revenue range and data source
- Enterprise-grade data export functionality
- Secure administrative interface for data management
- Real-time data validation and verification
- High-performance caching layer

## System Requirements

- Response Time: < 2 seconds for data filtering operations
- Data Accuracy: 100% validation of imported benchmark data
- System Availability: 99.9% uptime (excluding planned maintenance)
- User Capacity: Support for 1000+ concurrent users

## Architecture

The platform implements a modern microservices architecture:

- **Frontend**: React-based single-page application
- **Backend**: Node.js microservices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data persistence
- **Cache**: Redis for high-performance data access
- **CDN**: Global content delivery network
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 with role-based access control

For detailed architecture information, see our [technical documentation](docs/architecture.md).
