# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1 Purpose

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for a SaaS Benchmarks Platform. The document serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, project managers, stakeholders, and quality assurance teams involved in the development and deployment of the platform.

## 1.2 Scope

The SaaS Benchmarks Platform is a web-based solution designed to provide comprehensive benchmark data for key SaaS metrics. The platform will:

- Present benchmark data across 14 essential SaaS KPIs including financial, operational, and growth metrics
- Enable data filtering by Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) ranges and data sources
- Display statistical distributions (5th to 90th percentiles) for each metric
- Provide a public-facing interface for data consumption
- Include an administrative backend for data management and maintenance
- Support data export capabilities
- Ensure secure access control for administrative functions

Key benefits include:

- Centralized access to SaaS industry performance metrics
- Data-driven decision making for SaaS companies
- Flexible filtering for relevant peer group comparison
- Secure and maintainable platform for benchmark data management

The platform explicitly excludes:

- Raw data storage of individual company metrics
- Real-time data integration with external systems
- Predictive analytics or forecasting capabilities
- User account management for public access to the front but to the back is neccesary as only admins can edit data

# 2. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

## 2.1 Product Perspective

The SaaS Benchmarks Platform operates as a standalone web-based system that serves as a centralized repository for SaaS industry performance metrics. The platform interfaces with:

- Google OAuth 2.0 for administrative authentication
- Web browsers for public data consumption
- Backend database for benchmark data storage
- Export systems for data extraction to common formats

## 2.2 Product Functions

The platform provides the following core functions:

- Display of benchmark data across 14 SaaS KPIs with statistical distributions
- Interactive filtering by ARR ranges and data sources
- Data visualization through responsive tables and percentile displays
- Administrative interface for benchmark data management including:
  - CRUD operations for metrics, data sources, and benchmark values
  - Bulk data import capabilities
  - Audit logging of administrative actions
- Data export functionality for filtered datasets

## 2.3 User Characteristics

### Public Users

  - Export file size limited to 10MB
- Security Constraints:
  - Admin access restricted to authorized Google accounts
  - No storage of individual company data
  - Compliance with data privacy regulations
- Operational Constraints:
  - Regular data updates required for relevance
  - Limited to predefined ARR ranges and metrics

## 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions

- Benchmark data sources remain available and reliable
- Statistical distributions (5th to 90th percentile) provide sufficient insight
- Public access doesn't require user authentication

### Dependencies
